# Notification Infrastructure For Developers

Compiling a list of all notification infrastructure service for developers. This is a new product category where the product solves the core engineering problem in building a notification system inside products. I'd love to see your contributions to this list as PR.

I'm compiling a list of all such products that helps developers to build a notification infrastructure without much effort.

## Courier

[Courier](https://courier.com) helps product development teams to manage all product-triggered communications (email, chat, in-app, SMS, push, etc.) in one place through API and a web studio. The platform offers three tiers - free, developer and business. Users can upgrade features and support as their requirement scales.

## Engagespot
[Engagespot](https://engagespot.co) allows building product notifications for multiple channels (In-App, Email, and Push) using a single API, that includes a front-end UI kit that is heavily customizable. It also allows developers to build delivery routing and a notification preference manager for users. There is a free plan to get started.

## Knock
[Knock](https://knock.app) is a flexible notification infrastructure that can be built to scale as per the business requirements. The APIs used in this notification infrastructure allows developers to handle the most complex notification use cases that are built on top of primitives. The platform offers a pay-as-you-go model, which helps scale as per need. There are no upfront fees or infrastructure setup required.
